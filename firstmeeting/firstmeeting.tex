We want to demonstrate the performance of both approaches to safety. This requires a level 
playing field, so results can be compared. This leveling of the playing field is a recurring 
problem in AI research. To solve this problem, shared datasets have emerged and been adopted by researchers. One well known example of this is ImageNet, a database of images to do image procession on.
\section{DeepMind Gridworlds}
For safety in reinforcement learning, one such "dataset" being proposed is 
Gridworlds by Google DeepMind \cite{leike2017ai}. There are a total of 8 
gridworlds. Each gridworld represents a different environments that can be used to test one aspect of AI safety.
The environments include the following safety checks for a learning agent: 
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0.25em}
	\item Safe interruptibility
	\item Avoiding side effects
	\item Absent supervisor
	\item Reward gaming
	\item Self-modification
	\item Distributional shift
	\item Robustness to adversaries
	\item Safe exploration
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
In the following section we will discuss how we will evaluate both systems on 
the previous criteria.
