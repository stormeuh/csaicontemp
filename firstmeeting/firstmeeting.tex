We want to demonstrate the performance of both approaches to safety. This requires a level 
playing field, so results can be compared. This leveling of the playing field is a recurring 
problem in AI research. To solve this problem, shared datasets have emerged and been adopted by researchers. One well known example of this is ImageNet, a database of images to do image procession on.
\section{DeepMind Gridworlds}
For safety in reinforcement learning, one such "dataset" being proposed is Gridworlds by Google DeepMind \cite{leike2017ai}.
